# Datacamp-PostgreSQL-SQL-DataScience
In my 7th semester, I have taken up the Data Science course. It's my third week in this course, and we have started with PostgreSQL. For me, it's more of a refresher on my database concepts, but I've also learned many new concepts. Our course professor is giving assignments on DataCamp Classroom, which include:
Introduction to SQL
Intermediate SQL
Joining Data in SQL
Data Manipulation in SQL
Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions
So far, this is all we have learned in this journey, which has been almost one out of four months.
